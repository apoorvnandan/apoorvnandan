### What I'm upto:
- I am building a tensor library from scratch [tensor.h](https://github.com/apoorvnandan/tensor.h) and [lilgrad](https://github.com/apoorvnandan/lilgrad)
- I am building a ML powered product analytics tool - [Crunch](https://www.crunchit.ai/)

### What I have worked on:
- **Language and speech modelling:** At [ObserveAI](https://www.observe.ai/) I was training language models (variants of BERT mostly) and experimenting with different pretraining algorithms for speech data to extract the most usable embeddings for downstream models.
- **Research:** Language Agnostic Speech Embeddings for Emotion Classification -[PDF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jaXJWbbBvG_) [ICML](https://icml-sas.gitlab.io/)
- **Keras documentation examples:**
  - Generative models: [Miniature GPT](https://keras.io/examples/generative/text_generation_with_miniature_gpt/)
  - Reinforcement Learning: [Actor Critic Method](https://keras.io/examples/rl/actor_critic_cartpole/)
  - NLP: [Text Extraction with BERT](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_extraction_with_bert/)
  - ASR: [Sequence to sequence speech recognition with Transformers](https://keras.io/examples/audio/transformer_asr/)
- **Random minimal implementations**: [Prototypical Networks](https://apoorvnandan.github.io/2020/12/14/prototypical-networks/), [UNet](https://apoorvnandan.github.io/2020/08/30/unet-keras/), [Masked language model training](https://apoorvnandan.github.io/2020/08/15/bert-pretraining/), [Causal dilated convolutions with attention](https://apoorvnandan.github.io/2020/08/24/encoder-decoder-asr/), [Training on TPUs (Old)](https://apoorvnandan.github.io/2020/04/19/training-transformers-on-tpu/)
